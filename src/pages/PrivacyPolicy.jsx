        <p>
          Welcome to WatchShark. We are committed to protecting your privacy.
          This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information on our website.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          WatchShark is designed to be a privacy-focused application. We do not
          require user accounts, and therefore, we do not collect any personally
          identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or
          phone number.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only data we store is your "Watchlist." This information is saved
          directly in your browser's <strong>Local Storage</strong>. It is not
          transmitted to our servers and is accessible only by you on your own
          device. Clearing your browser's cache or data will permanently delete
          your watchlist.
        </p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>
          Since we do not collect personal data, we do not use it for any
          purpose. The watchlist data stored in your browser is used solely to
          provide the core functionality of the appâ€”displaying your saved movies
          and TV shows.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          Our service utilizes The Movie Database (TMDB) API to fetch movie and
          TV show information. We do not share any data with TMDB. For video
          playback, we embed content from third-party services like VidSrc and
          2Embed. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these
          external sites. We encourage you to review their privacy policies if
          you have concerns.
